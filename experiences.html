        <h3>Here I´m sharing my most influencial travel experiences, which I still remember every day</h3>

    <div>My journey began bright and early on the morning of 9 September.
        I said good-bye to all my family and got into a flight from the Dresden Airport (DRS) to Frankfurt (FRA).
        There I already practised my Spanish skills by talking to Costa Rican people while waiting for my connecting flight to San José.
        Then it was time for boarding. As I set down, I noticed that the woman who was talking to me at the gate was exactly the same woman
        sitting next to me on my flight. What a coincidance!
        After a 13-hour-flight, I finally arrived in San José.
        The migration office was quite skeptical, because I didn´t have a hotel reservation, because I was staying with a host family, organized by a german agency.
        I'm glad I had a return ticket. I think otherwise they wouldn´t have let me into the Country.
        At the end, everything turned out just fine and I got a tourist visa for 180 days.
        I was picked up at the airport by a guy of the travel agency who drove me to the home of my host family.
        Here my mama-tica Alba already waited for me with a plate of Gallo Pinto (rice and beans), the tradtional Costa Rican food.
